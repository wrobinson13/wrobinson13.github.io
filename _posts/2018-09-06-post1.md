Everytime I get on the elevator in front of class 455 in the business building there is an awful awkward silence. It's the same people everyday but we never talk to each other it's just a miserable ride getting more painful with each floor we pass. Not because we dont like each other or anything like that I just think everyone in the computer science department (including myself) is a little awkward so it might take until the end of the school year for us to warm up to each other.

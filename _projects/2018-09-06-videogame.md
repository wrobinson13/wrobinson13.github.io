## Video Game Project

Me and a couple of my friends are working on a game called Siblings of the Sword. We basically got the general fundamentals that we want our game to have and now is the hard part; Actually getting it done. We plan on making it a free world, sword based battle, with a very cool story. Not a right now project by any means but once we get more experience and are no longer broke college students we will make this game a reality.
